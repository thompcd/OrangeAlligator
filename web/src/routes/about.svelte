<h1>About OAS</h1>

<p>
Orange Alligator Solutions brings the technology and efficiencies of large companies to smaller local businesses, helping them and their communities grow. We believe that better local business leads to better lives for everyone in those communities.
</p>

<h2>What is OAS?</h2>

<p>
OAS offers business owners the benefit of dealing with a single point of contact to manage any project that entails expanding their business. We are primarily a small software development firm in Tulsa, OK, backed by a network of specialized consultants, allowing us to fulfill any needs of growing businesses.
</p>
<p>
Often, software projects can require expertise outside of the realm of just code. As an owner, you may know that you want to control a machine with your phone, but you donâ€™t have the time to perform research, hire an expert in mobile development, hire an expert in mechanical engineering and coordinate the project. Automation often requires mechanical specialists, websites often require graphics, branding and social media specialists and data visualization often requires IT and graphic specialists.
</p>
<p>
We have crafted a network to ensure each project is completed on time with exceptional quality by filling key roles with experts in their domains. Project management, consultation with these subject-matter experts and their coordination with the software is handled by OAS, keeping you the business owner available to remain productive
</p>
